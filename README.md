# POC Invidious Downloader

This is a proof-of-concept to download videos from YouTube. Focus here is audio-only, so video might not be included.

The script saves the success rate of each instance, so it might be faster on the second run.

## Usage

```console
python main.py dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
